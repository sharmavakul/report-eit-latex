% General  instructions / Best Practice Rules:
% ------------------------------------
% * Only one sentence per line!
% * Use active voice whenever possible! ("we have investigated" instead of "it
%   was investigated")
% * Use past progressive instead of simple past! ("Banks et al. have shown"
%   instead of "Banks et al. showed")
% * Mark open points with \todo{ <Name of assigned person>: ... }
% * Only commit after checking that it compiles. 
% * Use \cref{<label>} only, no \ref !
% * For abbreviations, always use the Glossaries package and \gls{<abbrv>} or
%   \glspl{<abbrv>} ! --> ensures that every abbreviation is introduced correctly

\section*{Abstract}
\text
Cloud computing has been a revolutionary technology for more than two decades supporting all sizes of businesses.
A recent survey by International Data Group showed 69\% of businesses are already using cloud technology, and 18\% plan to implement cloud-computing solutions.
The high volume of data generated by the organizations flows to the cloud.
This opens the door for accidental or malicious leaks of sensitive data.
Malicious actors such as attackers or hackers exploit vulnerabilities associated with cloud security to exfiltrate essential data and information for profit or other purposes from the organization’s network \cite{1}.


Securing data is not just a process of protecting data from unauthorized users, but it is an act of preventing unauthorized access, modification, or destruction of data.
Cloud services provide numerous features that make accessibility of data a lot easier for the developers, but at the same time introduce many unauthorized access issues.
As a matter of fact, organizations must rethink strengthening their network security to avoid such unauthorized access that leads to service disruption and sometimes causes reputation damage \cite{1}.

The main outcome of this thesis work is to highlight a few security vulnerabilities in Amazon Web Services (AWS) services namely EC2, IAM, S3, RDS, and Lambda, and assess them using a security assessment framework called Prowler.
Prowler is an open-source AWS CLI tool for auditing, security best practices assessment, forensics readiness, and hardening.
Security frameworks protect a user’s account against security vulnerabilities.
Prowler, a market-leading security tool performs the assessment of security vulnerabilities in AWS accounts.
It helps organizations to implement practices that ensure a secure and protected environment in place.
At the end of this thesis work, the efficiency of Prowler is evaluated and compared against other security tools.
